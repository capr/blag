## Why does everybody have to be so stupid?

That's right. I'm a hater. Not a week passes before I ask myself this question again.

Programming has eaten my life. And it still does, because I love it so much.
But boy, if I were to count the man-hours we're losing every day in this 
activity, profession, whatever you like to call it, doing useless crap that 
we would never have to do if we'd only be just a little bit smarter on 
how we do it, the graveyard would be miles long.

I have accumulated a lot of negative thoughts about this industry over the years,
and I'm going to vent in here until something happens, either I get tired, 
indifferent, or realize my ignorance and change the way I see things 
(fat chance - not with that attitude, hater boy). Well, anything's possible. 

Until then, stay tuned, because I have a lot of things to get off my chest.
