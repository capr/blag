So this here is my little corner where I consume my trolling impulses so they don't spread 
to other places like youtube comments or reddit (they still do, but this helps a lot).

[I make an issue](https://github.com/capr/sketchbook/issues) whenever I have to get something off my chest.
There's also lists of things - those get updated periodically whenever I get a new idea 
or want to expand on a topic, so the format is more like a wiki than a blog.
