# Why does everybody have to be so stupid?

That's right. I'm a hater. Not a week passes before I ask myself this question again.
If I were to count the man-hours we're collectively wasting every day in this activity 
doing useless crap, the graveyard would be miles long.

This here is my little corner where I bitch about programming, life, the Universe and everything.
I make an [issue](https://github.com/capr/sketchbook/issues) whenever I have to get something off my chest.
There's also lists of things - those get updated periodically whenever I get a new idea 
or want to expand on a topic, so the format is more like a wiki than a blog.

### Nov 6, 2020

New issue: I rant about [dumb tech that everybody thinks is hot](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/9). What could that be?

### Nov 4, 2020

## People and things to check out

Basically [my bookmarks (tech-related)](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/7), just so I don't forget... Updated periodically. 
I also keep [a non-tech-related list](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/8).

## Why Lua has no library ecosystem

Alright, it's time to bash on my favorite language a little bit. Specifically the problem of libraries because Lua doesn't have many good ones and because it's a common ritual for someone to raise the issue on the Lua mailing list once a year and then nothing is done about it, a tradition that goes back many years on that list. Can we do something about that? [Read more](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/1)

## Design patterns from hell and object-oriented programming

Let's see what some reputable people in the field have to say about it. [Read more](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/3)

## The rule of 10

The rule of 10 states that for every factor of 10 in scale, a new set of problems dominates.

The idea here is that software design is not scale invariant. Significant scale differences change things in fundamental ways (eg. human-scale insects wouldn't work and vice versa). As a counterpoint to that, the ideas about abstraction and process _are_ scale invariant, so eg. the concept of a loop (so, repetition) is so fundamental to the idea of automation that it appears  in one form or another at every level of abstraction.

## Confession of an idiot programmer [1](https://wiki.c2.com/?IdiotProgrammer)

> I am an idiot. That has profoundly affected the way I code. [Read more](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/4).

## Text-based protocols

If you ever get to read the RFCs on the HTTP protocol, that marvelous piece of engineering that even got its inventor the blessings of Her Majesty The Queen herself, you'll quickly realize what a miracle it is that our computers even start when we plug them in. I for one am amazed how Google can track my online behavior so well based on those cookie RFCs because if my calculations are correct, those things should just not work. So there you go. Something to be grateful for. You're welcome.

## The way we distribute and run software is fundamentally broken

The software culture and industry is shaped and regulated by the ways in which software gets on people's computers. And we're doing it all wrong. [Read more](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/5)

## The Internet culture is shaped by a limitation of the IP protocol

People tend to underestimate the extent to which hidden technological limitations contribute to the shape of the culture that forms around a certain technology. "The medium is the message" is deeper than expected. [Read more](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/6)

## Most programming is at the wrong level of abstraction

This is a complex topic, but it boils down to how we view programming languages in this culture. Even though there's a proliferation of new languages in the last years, every one of them tries hard to create its own bubble, to distinguish itself and specialize without also focusing on interoperability and embeddability so that it can be easily used from other languages and contexts. More so, we simply aren't yet able to envision a tool that can work well at multiple levels of abstraction, which leaves us endlessly reinventing the same wheels with every new tool, eg. every language reimplements the same cross-platform GUI library.

## C in recent years

C was once great but it's getting worse. Can we do something about it? [Read more](https://github.com/capr/blog/issues/2)

## The web (still) sucks

That [comment](https://github.com/whatwg/xhr/issues/20#issuecomment-408677857) felt so good. Once again, condescending smart-ass W3C people trying to protect the poor users from us clueless devs.
